## Create a Pull Request

When making pull requests to the repository, make sure to follow these guidelines for both bug fixes and new features:

* **Before creating a pull request**, file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Bergx2/BuchISY/issues) so that maintainers and the community can discuss the problem and potential solutions before you spend time on an implementation.
* **In your PR's description**, link to any related issues or pull requests to give reviewers the full context of your change.
* **For commit messages**, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

**Example commit messages:**

* `feat(ui): add invoice search functionality`
* `fix(core): resolve ARM64 crash on vision extraction`
* `docs(readme): update installation guide for Windows`

### Features

Before creating pull requests for new features, first file a GitHub Issue describing the reasoning and motivation for the feature. This gives maintainers and the community the opportunity to provide feedback on your idea before implementing it.

### Bug Fixes

For bug fixes, please:

1. Create an issue describing the bug (if one doesn't exist)
2. Reference the issue in your PR: `Fixes #123`
3. Include test cases to prevent regression
4. Test on relevant platforms (macOS, Windows)
